# Tamil Conversational ASR Dataset

This is a dataset for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) focused on **conversational Tamil**, collected from various public sources on the web. Each sample is a short audio clip (averaging 10 seconds) paired with its corresponding transcription.

## Dataset Summary

- **Language:** Tamil (`ta`)
- **Domain:** Conversational speech
- **Average Duration per Clip:** ~10 seconds
- **Format:** Audio (.wav) + text
- **Sample Rate:** 16kHz recommended
- **Total Examples:**
  - **PureVox:**
    - Train: 12,371
    - Test: 3,093
  - **AmbientVox:**
    - Train: 22,057
    - Test: 5,515

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into two subsets:

### PureVox
The PureVox subset contains cleaner audio with minimal background noise, making it ideal for baseline ASR model training and evaluation.

Each example contains the following fields:

| Field         | Type     | Description                                  |
|---------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `file_name`   | `string` | Name of the original audio file              |
| `start_time`  | `float`  | Start time of the segment in seconds         |
| `end_time`    | `float`  | End time of the segment in seconds           |
| `duration`    | `string` | Duration of the segment                      |
| `text`        | `string` | Ground truth transcription in Tamil          |
| `file_path`   | `audio`  | The audio data itself                        |
| `__index_level_0__` | `int64` | Index identifier                        |

### AmbientVox
The AmbientVox subset contains conversational Tamil with realistic background noise and varying acoustic conditions, making it suitable for training robust ASR models for real-world applications.

Each example contains the following fields:

| Field         | Type     | Description                                  |
|---------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `duration`    | `float64`| Duration of the segment in seconds           |
| `file_name`   | `string` | Name of the original audio file              |
| `start_time`  | `string` | Start time of the segment                    |
| `video_id`    | `string` | ID of the source video                       |
| `text`        | `string` | Ground truth transcription in Tamil          |
| `end_time`    | `string` | End time of the segment                      |
| `file_path`   | `audio`  | The audio data itself                        |

## Usage

This dataset can be used for training or evaluating ASR models, especially those based on architectures like [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) or [Wav2Vec2](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=automatic-speech-recognition&sort=downloads).

You can load each subset individually:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load PureVox subset (cleaner audio)
purevox_dataset = load_dataset("ragunath-ravi/TamilVoiceCorpus", name="PureVox")

# Load AmbientVox subset (with background noise)
ambientvox_dataset = load_dataset("ragunath-ravi/TamilVoiceCorpus", name="AmbientVox")
```

## Comparison of Subsets

| Feature | PureVox | AmbientVox |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Background Noise | Minimal | Present |
| Size (Train) | 12,371 examples | 22,057 examples |
| Size (Test) | 3,093 examples | 5,515 examples |
| Total Dataset Size | ~5.4 GB | ~33 GB |
| Best Use Case | Baseline model training, Controlled evaluations | Robust model training, Real-world applications |
